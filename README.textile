h1. About

This is a small application I came up with to solve the problem of non-technical clients wanting to share large files publicly (eg, PDF articles attached to prospect emails) and privately (eg, Illustrator documents swapped around with design firms).

I'm in the process of building it back up after it was stripped down a bit for public consumption.  At the moment you can run 'rake db:sample' to load up a few sample users.
